# [Two Dice Game](https://psynut.github.io/BensGame/)

Ben made this relatively simple dice game up. Here's the webpage that allows two players to enjoy the game from the internet.

Rules of the game:
Two players both start with 13 points at the start of the game.
The two player each roll two dice each turn. The difference between the two dice are compared. Whichever player's difference is smallest wins.
If the differences between the two is the same for the two players, then the highest roll of the white die, wins.
If the differences between the two dice is the same, and both players rolled the same number on the white die, the player with the highest roll on the green die wins.
If the rolls are identical, this turn is a tie -- no points are gained or lost.
The winner of turn gains the number of points equal to the loser's roll of the white die.
The loser of the turn loses the number of points equal to the loser's roll of the white die.

If a player has lost all their points, they lose. (The winning player will have scored 26 or more points.)
